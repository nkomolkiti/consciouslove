                <p>Parents spend so much time talking to their children, and wondering why they don't seem to hear them. It is often that the parents talk without understanding how their children receive the message. Listening to and repeating after the child is one of the key strategies to communicate effectively.</p>
                <p>Specific actions like making eye contact, kneeling down to your child's level and even tilting your head show your child you are listening. "If you find yourself thinking of your response while your child is talking, then you're not really listening." &mdash; <font class="italic">Michael Thompson, Ph.D. Co-author, Raising Cain, Senior Project Advisor</font></p>
                <p>If you are on an important phone call and can't talk to your child at that moment, ignoring the child or saying "shut up" in a stern voice just isn't appropriate. You might say "Let's talk in a few minutes; I'm in the middle of something," to let her know you will definitely listen to her afterwards.</p>

                <div class="three-column">
                <p>"Can't you be like your sister?", "I'm sorry but mistakes happened." Or "Stop crying now, just stop it!" <br>and other phrases we blurted out in a heated argument. Whenever a parent feels the power struggle, either from a little child throwing tantrums or being criticized by her, the helplessness brings upon things we wish we didn't say.</p>
                <p>Instead of beating yourself up when you hear your parent's voice come out of your mouth, <font class="bolded">the best way is to admit you're wrong and apologize.</font></p>
                <p>Tip01: Apologize for your behavior, not for yourself. "I've been thinking about what happened and I don't like what I did." </p>
                <p>Tip02: You can ask your child "What could I have done differently?"</p>
                <p>Tip03: Get a time out for calm down and rethink about the situation. "I'm sorry, I'm not thinking clearly right now. I'll get back to you."</p>
                <p>Remember, take a breath and apologize. Think about how you might behave differently next time, and then move on.</p>

                <div class="three-column">
                <p>Allow your child's negative feelings to come out, even if it is hard to take. Simply being there is sometimes more than enough.</p>
                <p>Remember to be true to your word. Often time, parents, despite telling the child they can accept anything, cannot bring themselves to accept what their child is telling them. This often leads to the child feeling betrayed in the most needed moments. If something is hard to take in, tell your child that you will need some time to think it over, but NEVER reject her as a person.</p>

                <p>"Just taking the time to stop and consider your child's idea can make an enormous difference. And don't be afraid to be wrong. Kids love correcting their parents. There is an enormous pressure parents feel to 'be right' and that's just not necessary." &mdash; <font class="italic">Michael Thompson, Ph.D.</font></p>
                <p>Pausing forces you to slow down and makes the answer not feeling too 'snappy' or 'inconsiderate' to your child. For example, even if your answer is "No, we are not getting the doll," <font class="bolded">pausing makes your child feel heard</font>, because you have stopped to consider her opinion.</p>
                <p>You might share your thought process behind the answer out loud, giving your child the explanation of how you get to the answer. For example, if your child asks if she could sleep over, you might say, "I know you want a sleep over, but your grandmother may want to see you this weekend when she visits. Let me talk to her."</p>

                <p><font class="bolded">"The negotiation between parents and kids can actually be a great learning experience for your kids.</font> If you don't negotiate, your children may not learn how to deal with conflicts constructively. If you don't teach them how to work with you, they may never learn how to work with others." &mdash; <font class="italic">Scott Brown, author of How to Negotiate With Kids Even When You Think You Shouldn't.</font></p>
                <p>There are times when we repeat same phrases over and over: "It's time for bed." "It's dinnertime." "It's time to wake up." And often meet with answers such as "Five more minutes". Negotiation is tiring, but important. Parents need to learn how to manage their own emotions and frustrations, or else everything blows up and the negotiation fails.</p>
                <p>Remember, <font class="bolded">start an agreement, not an argument.</font> Say "Would you like to walk a dog." would give you more of a coorporation than saying "You need to walk the dog."</p>
                <p>Also, <font class="bolded">keep their age in mind.</font> If your school-age child doesn't like carrots, you might ask, "What vegetable would you like instead?" If your preschooler is not interested in eating vegetables at all, consider finding vegetables that are a little more sweet while also tell them stories about vegetable heroes.</p>

                <p>Children sense what parents are feeling, and often pay more attention to the tone of the words. Parents often pay more attention to the intention.</p>
                <p>Therefore, eventhough a sentence was stated with good intention, the children might take it in a completely different way than how we expect them to.</p>
                <p>"If your tone and words are in sync you are giving a clear message. If there is a discrepancy, your child may wonder, 'What do you really mean?' If you are saying angry words without emotional conviction, it's confusing. Your child may wonder what is really bothering you." &mdash; <font class="italic">Susanna Neumann, Ph.D.</font></p>
                <p>The best way to listen to yourself is to listen from the child's perspective. If you feel a conflict brewing, ask yourself, "Would I like to be spoken to this way?" From this, find why you get mad at something and try to understand what causes the tension between you and the child.</p>

                  Crying and short phrases are how toddlers communicate. They use words such as "No" and "mine" to claim space and take control of their new world. <font class="bolded">It is developmentally important for a toddler to say these words.</font> Asserting their independence is an early, important step towards becoming their own person, seperate from you.</p>

                  Be aware that tone and body language make a difference. When a baby hears "Stop!" he will sometimes cry, because he is reacting to the sharpness of the command. Using a soft, loving voice when will comfort your child because of the soothing tone. Also, talk to your child even if you're not sure if he understands! He will copy things you do or say so make a good example for him to follow.</p>

                  There will be lots of repeated sentences or word from the preschoolers. This include the repetitive 'why' questions that might drive some parents crazy. This is how they start to develop their understanding of the world and how to express their stories; they are not trying to annoy you. It is also your responsibility to explain things they do not understand with patience.</p>
                
                <p><font class="approachText">PARENT'S APPROACH</font><br>
                  Helping them develop emotions into words are important steps for parents to take. Preschoolers also want to gain some control by making their own decision. By asking "would you like to do this before or after dinner?" is a nice way to let your child decide. By dictating every choice it might lead to an argument or end up diminish your child's ability to make choice on her own.</p>

                  The child will appear more independent and spend less time interact with the parent. They often have their own communities and don't find parents the most authoritative figure in their lives.

                  As your child gets older, you won't be as physically present in her life, but you are still needed for emotional support. If you want to know what's going on in her days, the key is to keep up the listening and focus less on solutions. "A lot of times, as parents, we want to be the problem solver, but as soon as we start problem solving, judgment happens. People don't like being judged." says Julie Romanowski, a parenting coach in Vancouver. Also, don't let your panic express on your face when teens decide to open up on certain topics with you, because that might shut them down.</p>

                <p class="bottom26 three-span">A toddler always spills his food. You tell him to stop but never succeed.</p>

                <p class="bottom5"><font class="sec303title">WHAT'S HAPPENING?</font></p>
                <p>Toddlers are simply discovering and asserting themselves into the world. They need to feel the texture and colors of the food, and what will happen if they drop it on the ground.</p>
                
                <p class="bottom5"><font class="sec303title">WHAT TO DO?</font></p>
                <p>To limit the mess while giving allowing the child to discover the world, place a large wipeable mat underneath the high chair so you're not worried about his messy eating. Don't instantly clean up everytime he makes a mess as this will drive you mad and it might tempt him to play a game of "Let's see how many times Mom will pick up my cup!" </p>
                <p>Be sure you know when enough is enough; if he throws more food than he's eating, it's probably time to end the meal.</p>

                <p class="bottom26 three-span">You pick your child up from a preschool, and ask how she did that day. "I don't know" or, "Nothing" are the answers.</p>

                <p class="bottom5"><font class="sec303title">WHAT'S HAPPENING?</font></p>
                <p>Preschoolers are at the age where they can understand a lot but are still developing the language skills needed to express their thoughts. Since it is a lot of work going through how to describe about a day in the best way to make parents happy, it is easier to say "I don't know."</p>

                <p>They're not ignoring you, but rather would need a little help in zeroing in on the detail. As a parent, asking specific questions helps your child articulate her feelings and thoughts about what's happening at specific moments. If your child mentions a negative thing to you, overreact might shut her down, as she would thought that what she is saying upsets her parent and it is better to not talk about it. As a parent, it is better to stay calm and let your child finishes her stories.</p>

                <p>He is being bullied. Friends are very influential and important for children of this age, as it means fitting into and being accepted by the community of friends. Being bullied is like being casted out from the community, resulting in not wanting to face the same torment at school any longer.</p>
                
                <p class="bottom5"><font class="sec303title">WHAT TO DO?</font></p>
                <p>Bullying is a serious topic, and parents should not brush it off by simply stating the child has to 'tough out'. Being bullied might make the child to feel unwanted and insecure about himself as a person. Parents first and foremost should comfort the child, accept his feelings and teaches him to ask for help from teachers at school. Then you'll need to report this to the child's teacher and figure things out at school.</p>

                <p class="bottom5"><font class="sec303title">WHAT'S HAPPENING?</font></p>
                <p>Gaming is good fun. Teens are more independent and less likely to simply follow their parents' order without proper explanation or discussion.</p>
                
                <p class="bottom5"><font class="sec303title">WHAT TO DO?</font></p>
                <p>You might start with showing your interests in the game, asking what she likes to do in the game, etc. Try approaching her about the benefits and harms the game addiction produce when she is not in the middle of gaming. Explain your concern and negotiate about the timing or rules regarding gaming. It might be as simple as discussing about gaming for limited time during weekdays and unlimited time during weekends, as long as certain expectations are met. This will support her to be better at time-management skills. Make sure to praise her when she accomplishes what has been negotiated.</p>
