      <h2 class="bottom10">ABOUT VERBAL ABUSE</h2>
      <p>Psychological abuse of a child is a pattern of intentional verbal or behavioral actions or lack of actions that convey to a child the message that he or she is worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted, endangered, or only of value to meet someone else's needs. <font class="italic">&mdash; Samantha Gluck, a journalist specializing in healthcare trends, mental health, health and fitness</font></p>
      <p>Verbal abuse doesn't have to be loud; it can be quiet. Verbal abuse can be very harmful on children who haven't developed a conscious defense mechanism. The effects on the child can include, but not limited to, anxiety, depression, and self-criticism. Self-criticism is a mental habit of attributing all mistakes to yourself, such as "I failed because I am stupid" or "Nothing good will ever happen to me because I'm not good enough".</p>
      <p>Sometimes it can come out as a joke (which is obviously not funny), or as a reflection of one's insecurity. The child might also view it as 'normal' and it becomes the continuation of action.</p>
      <p>Underneath are gathered statistics from a survey we've sent out to our college educated target ranging from 20s to 50s:</p>

      <h2 class="bottom30">COMMON TYPES OF VERBAL ABUSE</h2>

      <div id='cssmenu'>
      <ul>

         <li class='has-sub'><a href='#'><span><p class="typesTitle">01 ABUSIVE ANGER
           <font class="togglePlus"></font><font class="toggleMinus hide"></font></p></span></a>
            <ul><p>
              Any form of yelling and screaming, particularly out of context. Even yelling "Shut up!" is abusive. No one deserves to be yelled at.
            </p></ul>
         </li>

         <hr>

         <li class='has-sub'><a href='#'><span><p class="typesTitle">02 DISAPPEARING ACT: IGNORED<font class="togglePlus"></font><font class=" toggleMinus hide"></font></p></span></a>
            <ul><p>
              Children's information and relationships with the world come to them second-hand. With a caring parent who responds to their cues, they begin to understand that they matter and are worthy of attention; building healthy self-esteem.
              The children who are ignored instead question their place in the world, even though they don't know why.
            </p></ul>
         </li>

         <hr>

         <li class='has-sub'><a href='#'><span><p class="typesTitle">03 ABSENCE OF PRAISE & SUPPORT<font class="togglePlus"></font><font class=" toggleMinus hide"></font></p></span></a>
            <ul><p>
              People are not psychic and therefore do not know that they're appreciated without communication. Words that articulate why a child is worthy of love and attention are as essential as food, water, clothing, and shelter. They are needed for the child to thrive and develop normally.
            </p></ul>
         </li>

         <hr>

         <li class='has-sub'><a href='#'><span><p class="typesTitle">04 COMPARING & CRITICIZING<font class="togglePlus"></font><font class=" toggleMinus hide"></font></p></span></a>
            <ul><p>
              Being constantly compared to another person can either result in the child being pressured to be better in order to 'satisfy' the parents, or feeling like she is not loved, and becoming less confident in herself. Examples are such as "You did great on your exam but why can't you do that all the time?" and "Can't you be good like your sister?"
            </p></ul>
         </li>

         <hr>

         <li class='has-sub'><a href='#'><span><p class="typesTitle">05 JOKES<font class="togglePlus"></font><font class=" toggleMinus hide"></font></p></span></a>
            <ul><p>
              The parent may say something very upsetting to the child and, after seeing her reaction add, "It was just a joke!" This may result in the young child being insecure about whatever is made as a joke.
            </p></ul>
         </li>

         <hr>

         <li class='has-sub'><a href='#'><span><p class="typesTitle">06 GASLIGHTING<font class="togglePlus"></font><font class=" toggleMinus hide"></font></p></span></a>
            <ul><p>
              This is a form of manipulation that results in the child doubting his or her perceptions. It is a simple statement that says that something that happened didn't. It is very effective on the child because he accepts the adult's words as authority until he gets old enough to begin questioning his parent. This erodes the child's confidence in his own thoughts as children haven't developed conscious defense mechanisms.<br>
              Example: a mother promises a child candy if he's quiet, but when the child asks about the candy afterwards, she goes against her word by stating that she has not promised him anything.
            </p></ul>
         </li>

         <hr>

         <li class='has-sub'><a href='#'><span><p class="typesTitle">07 BLAMING<font class="togglePlus"></font><font class=" toggleMinus hide"></font></p></span></a>
            <ul><p>
              The child gets scolded for something outside of his control, such as "I missed the interview because I have to take care of you." This leaves the child confused from being unfairly accused of something that is not his fault.
            </p></ul>
         </li>

         <hr>

         <li class='has-sub'><a href='#'><span><p class="typesTitle">08 FORGETTING<font class="togglePlus"></font><font class=" toggleMinus hide"></font></p></span></a>
            <ul><p>
              A parent who always forgets promises can result in a child feeling unworthy and angry.
            </p></ul>
         </li>

         <hr>

         <li class='has-sub'><a href='#'><span><p class="typesTitle">09 UNDERMINING<font class="togglePlus"></font><font class=" toggleMinus hide"></font></p></span></a>
            <ul><p>
              Imagine having a parent who undermines whatever the child is trying to do,whether it be deciding her own future, or striving to be best at something so her parents are proud of her. By undermining every action the child takes, it makes her question her own opinions and interests.
            </p></ul>
         </li>

         <hr>

         <li class='has-sub'><a href='#'><span><p class="typesTitle">10 FOR YOUR OWN GOOD<font class="togglePlus"></font><font class=" toggleMinus hide"></font></p></span></a>
            <ul><p>
              Most times, both the loud and the quiet kinds of verbal abuse are rationalized by the need to correct perceived flaws in the child's character or behavior. Hypercriticality (magnifying every misstep or mistake) may be "justified" by having to make sure the child "isn't too full of herself" and other self-serving statements. Delivered in a quiet tone, this barrage of criticism makes a child believe she's unworthy of attention and support because she's worthless.
            </p></ul>
         </li>

         <li class='has-sub'><a href='#'><span><p class="typesTitle">11 STONEWALLING<font class="togglePlus"></font><font class=" toggleMinus hide"></font></p></span></a>
            <ul><p>
              It's hard enough to deal with stonewalling when you're an adult&mdash;your partner's refusal to answer that ends up with frustration&mdash;but it's absolutely devastating to a child who doesn't have any way of defending herself. The child's self-esteem lowers as they think they aren't good enough to warrant their parents' attention.
            </p></ul>
         </li>

         <hr>

         <li class='has-sub'><a href='#'><span><p class="typesTitle">12 THREATENING<font class="togglePlus"></font><font class=" toggleMinus hide"></font></p></span></a>
            <ul><p>
              Threatening like throwing a child out of the house, or saying that people will hate him if he doesn't follow the parent's advice, create a sense that the child is not wanted.
            </p></ul>
         </li>

      </ul>

    <div class="marginLeft82 width520 paragraphText">
    <h2 class="bottom10">WHAT'S THE  IMPACT?</h2>
    <p>The impact of verbal aggression and abuse tends to be discounted and marginalized; there seems to be an unspoken agreement that such abuse is "only words," as people cite the children's rhyme: "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words shall never hurt me." This is not that people are not aware of verbal abuse, but rather there is not enough discussion about it.</p>
    <p>The positive clearly does not offset the negative. This means even if there are one loving parent and one abusive parent, words are still damaging. Science backs up that repetitive verbal abuse can lead to the psychological impact such as having low self-esteem, anxeity, and can affect the development of brains. Many of those experienced verbal abuse in their childhood can still hear negative voices in their head, and it takes a long time to rid of this mental habit and realize that it is not the reality of the situation. It poisons the family relationship, in which is the most essential to children's fundamental development in life.</p>
